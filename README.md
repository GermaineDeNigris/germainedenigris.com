# Germaine's Frontend Development Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal portfolio of frontend development projects. I started my journey as a UI/UX designer and have transitioned into the world of development, combining aesthetics with functionality. This repository showcases some of my most recent and exciting projects where design meets code.

## Projects

Here you'll find a selection of projects that I've worked on, demonstrating my skills in creating user-friendly, responsive, and engaging web applications. Each project folder contains a detailed explanation of the project and the technologies I applied.

## Getting Started

These projects were bootstrapped with Create React App, a powerful tool that helped me focus on writing code rather than setting up build environments.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/GermaineDeNigris/germainedenigris.com

Install NPM packages
sh
Copy code
npm install
Development
To start the project in development mode, run:

Copy code
npm start
Your default web browser will open automatically at http://localhost:3000.

Testing
Run the test suite with:

Copy code
npm test
This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

Building for Production
To build the app for production, run:

Copy code
npm run build
This will bundle React in production mode and optimize the build for the best performance, ready for deployment.

## Deployment

To make your website accessible to users, you'll need to deploy the production build to a web hosting service. If you're using services like Netlify or Vercel, they often provide a straightforward deployment process that integrates with your Git repository.

Here is a general outline of steps you might follow for deployment:

1. **Build Your Project**: Generate the production build of your application by running `npm run build`.
2. **Choose a Hosting Service**: Select a hosting provider that suits your needs. Netlify, Vercel, and GitHub Pages are popular choices for React applications.
3. **Follow Hosting Service Instructions**: Each hosting service will have its own set of instructions. Typically, this involves linking your Git repository to the service and setting up build commands and publish directories.
4. **Set Up Domain**: Configure your custom domain if you have one, or use the provided subdomain from the hosting service.
5. **Deploy**: Push your code to the designated branch (like `main` or `master`), or manually upload your build directory. Your hosting service will handle the rest and serve your application.

For detailed instructions tailored to Create React App, refer to the [official deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
